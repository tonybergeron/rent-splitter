Description
	What is it?
		Rent Splitter is a web application that helps apartment-mates split rent costs such as rent, utilities and groceries.
		
		Instead of one person making a utility payment and attempting to get the split cost back from the other rentors, the "rent due" each pay period is used as the great equilizer.
		The payment is tracked in the application and the contributed amount is deducted from the payers rent with an equal amount being split and added to the other rentors "rent due".
		
		At the end of the pay period everyone has their rent due amount. Community expenditures are evenly distributed and accounted for with the burden of being the payer being lifted. 
		
	What does it do?
		A payer adds a purchase/payment to be split among the rentors by adding it to the tracker for a certain pay period.  
		The purchase/payment will be split evenly (unless indicated otherwise) among the rentors.  The payer has already paid his amount of the purchase but the remainig amount owed by the other rentors is considered the "contributed" amount.
		The "contributed" amount is deducted from the payer's rent due amount that month.
		The "contributed" amount is then evenly distributed (unless indicated otherwise) among the other rentors by being added to their rent due amount.  
	
	
	So how does this help me?
		Each rentor will be given a rent due amount for a pay period that is automatically adjusted based on the community expenditures.  These rent due amounts will add up to the total rent amount the landlord (or landlady) expects to see. 
	
	Features:
		Track pay period expeditures 
		Automatically split tracked payments between all rentors or specific rentors
		One simple number to pay at the end of every pay period 
		Ability to adjust the "split percentage" for a tracked payment.
